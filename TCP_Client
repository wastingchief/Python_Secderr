#TCP Client 
#The basic points of this program are assuming
##We will always have a successful connection
###The server is always expecting us to send data first 
####The server is always sending data back in a timely fashion

# We will start asking who is our target
##target = input("What is your IPv4 target hostname?") 
##target_port = input("What port will you be connecting on?") 
##recv_port = ""
#Creating a socket object 
#"how our data will be transmitted"
#AF_INET = We will be using a standard IPv4 address or hostname
#SOCK_STREAM = We will be using our reliable (TCP) protocol as a client

#client = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)


#Connecting to the client 
#client.connect((target_host, target_prot))


#Send your data[transmission]
#Example "Get HTTP version 1.1" 
#sending string in bytes format to ommit error ive recived need to test again without encoding
